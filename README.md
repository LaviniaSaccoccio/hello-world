Passionate. Reliable. Goal Oriented.

I am a Physics master graduate at Sapienza University of Rome, with an internship at EPFL. I have strong research and data analysis background with expertise in particle and nuclear physics. 

I had a hard time choosing what I wanted to study at the university, because I had so many passions: botany, foreign languages, animals.. But then, during my last year of high school, my teacher made me fall in love with physics and it all began. I have always loved numbers and logical thinking, but after that I started seeing the world with different eyes. 

Collecting and analysing data is what I do every day and in every situation ( even at the grocery store or watching TV), and I love it. 

I love challenges. 

I am very passionate about challenging problems, and I love finding trends and stories in data, even in the most difficult situations. My master thesis concerned the study of the Swiss fusion reactor safety, a study no one ever did before. As of now, it is my biggest achievement, and I am proud and enthusiast of my analysis. Here I had to collect and analyse very large amounts of data and study them with my scripts. It was a huge challenge, but with hard work and dedication I overcame it, and obtained a wonderful result.

My specialties:
- Quickly learning new skills
- Programming languages: Python, SQL, Matlab, C, C++
- Statistical Analysis and Data Mining
- Visualization tools: Microsoft Power BI, Tableau
- Microsoft Office tools: Excel, Power Point, Word
- Machine Learning algorithms 
- Research & Development

I believe there is always something to learn, and that's why I am always following a new online course, reading a book or visiting a new Country. I've started learning R, and I am improving my Python programming.
I dream of a sustainable world not driven by oil and plastic, in which we have to be the change. I am a data-driver person but I am also a dreamer, yet really attentive to details. I am hard working and I strongly value teamwork, so that I can get to know people from different backgrounds and cultures.
